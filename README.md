## This is a repo of useful things to know for leetcode, such as common exercises, algorithms to learn that I will apply over and over, etc.

I don't expect this to be used by anyone, but if you happen to come across it somehow through Googling or finding my github some other way, I hope it either helps you, or if you are an employer, convinces you to hire me. 

Going to be mostly Python for a start because its my favourite language, but eventually I'll get to JavaScript and C# and some others and maybe turn it into a resource for people later on, but I don't even know what I'm having for lunch so maybe one thing at a time.
